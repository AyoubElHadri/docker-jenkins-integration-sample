# Docker Jenkins Integration Sample

This repository provides a sample setup for integrating Docker with Jenkins for continuous integration and deployment. The setup allows you to build, test, and deploy Dockerized applications using Jenkins pipelines.

## Prerequisites
To use this sample, you need to have the following prerequisites installed:

1. Docker: Install Docker on your machine. You can download it from the official Docker website and follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

2. Jenkins: Install Jenkins on your machine or use an existing Jenkins server. You can download Jenkins from the official Jenkins website and follow the installation instructions for your operating system.

## Getting Started
Follow these steps to set up the Docker Jenkins integration:

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/docker-jenkins-integration-sample.git`

2. Configure Jenkins:
   - Open Jenkins in your browser and go to the Jenkins dashboard.
   - Create a new Jenkins pipeline job.
   - In the pipeline configuration, specify the repository URL (`https://github.com/your-username/docker-jenkins-integration-sample.git`) and configure the necessary build triggers and options.

3. Build and deploy the Dockerized application:
   - Create a Jenkins pipeline script (Jenkinsfile) in the root of the cloned repository.
   - Use the provided sample Jenkinsfile in this repository as a reference.
   - Customize the Jenkinsfile according to your project requirements, such as build steps, test steps, and deployment steps.

4. Run the Jenkins pipeline:
   - Save the Jenkinsfile and trigger the Jenkins pipeline manually or by using the configured build triggers.
   - Jenkins will automatically build, test, and deploy the Dockerized application according to the steps defined in the Jenkinsfile.

5. Monitor the Jenkins pipeline:
   - Observe the Jenkins console output to track the progress of the pipeline.
   - Check the build status, test results, and deployment logs to ensure everything is working correctly.

## Additional Notes
- This sample assumes that you have basic knowledge of Docker and Jenkins pipelines.
- Make sure that Jenkins has sufficient permissions to access and control Docker on your machine or Docker server.
- Customize the Jenkinsfile according to your specific project requirements and Docker setup.
- You can extend this sample to include additional stages, such as pushing Docker images to a registry or deploying to different environments.
